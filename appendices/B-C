Appendix B: Zero-Shot Prompt Template
TASK: You are evaluating the quality of evaluative reasoning in a conclusion fragment from a program evaluation report.
ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK: Apply the Integrated Evaluative Reasoning Checklist to assess whether this conclusion demonstrates sound evaluative reasoning (insert Appendix A). 
IMPORTANT: These checkpoints are orienting heuristics, not algorithmic rules. Sound evaluative reasoning requires synthesis and professional judgment, not mechanical checklist completion. Consider how domains interact and how trade-offs are weighed. No single checkpoint is determinative—assess the conclusion holistically.
YOUR TASK:
1.	Classification: Classify this conclusion as either sound or not sound based on the overall quality of evaluative reasoning.
2.	Rationale: Provide a 2-4 sentence rationale explaining your judgment. Identify which domains were most salient to your decision and how you weighed any trade-offs.

YOUR RESPONSE:
Classification: [sound / not sound]
Rationale: [2-4 sentences explaining your judgment]
Appendix C: Few-Shot Prompt Template
TASK: You are evaluating the quality of evaluative reasoning in a conclusion fragment from a program evaluation report.
ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK: Apply the Integrated Evaluative Reasoning Checklist to assess whether this conclusion demonstrates sound evaluative reasoning (insert Appendix A). 
IMPORTANT: These checkpoints are orienting heuristics, not algorithmic rules. Sound evaluative reasoning requires synthesis and professional judgment, not mechanical checklist completion. Consider how domains interact and how trade-offs are weighed. No single checkpoint is determinative—assess the conclusion holistically.
CALIBRATION EXAMPLES:
Below are examples showing how to apply this framework:
Example 1:
Evaluative Conclusion Fragment Example 1: [Calibration example 1 - sound fragment text]
Classification: sound
Rationale: [Expert rationale explaining why this demonstrates sound evaluative reasoning, identifying key strengths]
Example 2:
Evaluative Conclusion Fragment: [Calibration example 2 - sound fragment text]
Classification: sound
Rationale: [Expert rationale explaining why this demonstrates sound evaluative reasoning, identifying key strengths]
Example 3:
Evaluative Conclusion Fragment: [Calibration example 3 - not sound fragment text]
Classification: not sound
Rationale: [Expert rationale explaining why this demonstrates weak evaluative reasoning, identifying primary deficiencies]
Example 4:
Evaluative Conclusion Fragment: [Calibration example 4 - not sound fragment text]
Classification: not sound
Rationale: [Expert rationale explaining why this demonstrates weak evaluative reasoning, identifying primary deficiencies]
