TASK: You are evaluating the quality of evaluative reasoning in a conclusion fragment from a program evaluation report.

ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK: Apply the Integrated Evaluative Reasoning Checklist below to assess whether this conclusion demonstrates sound evaluative reasoning.

[IERC CHECKLIST — INSERT APPENDIX A CONTENT HERE]
[Replace this block with the full 22-checkpoint Integrated Evaluative Reasoning Checklist
across the following 6 domains:
  Domain 1: Evaluative Framing
  Domain 2: Evidence Base
  Domain 3: Argument Structure
  Domain 4: Synthesis & Integration
  Domain 5: Evaluative Conclusion
  Domain 6: Qualifications & Transparency
Remove this placeholder before running the benchmark.]

IMPORTANT: These checkpoints are orienting heuristics, not algorithmic rules. Sound evaluative reasoning requires synthesis and professional judgment, not mechanical checklist completion. Consider how domains interact and how trade-offs are weighed. No single checkpoint is determinative — assess the conclusion holistically.

YOUR TASK:
1. Classification: Classify this conclusion as either sound or not sound based on the overall quality of evaluative reasoning.
2. Rationale: Provide a 2-4 sentence rationale explaining your judgment. Identify which domains were most salient to your decision and how you weighed any trade-offs.

YOUR RESPONSE:
Classification: [sound / not sound]
Rationale: [2-4 sentences explaining your judgment]
